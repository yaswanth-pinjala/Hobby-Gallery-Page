# Hobby-Gallery-Page
In this project, you will create a gallery page that showcases a collection of your hobbies or interests.
The page could feature images, text descriptions, and perhaps a brief introduction about each hobby.
This project will teach you how to organize and present content in a gallery format using HTML and
CSS.
Small Step-by-Step Guide:
Create a new HTML file named hobby-gallery.html.
Add the following content inside the <body>:
Introduction section with a brief description of your hobbies or interests.
Use <div> or <section> to group each hobby.
Each hobby section should include:
An image showcasing the hobby using the <img> tag.
A description using <p> about why you enjoy the hobby.
Optionally, links to articles, videos, or resources related to the hobby.
Style with an external CSS file:
Use CSS Grid or Flexbox to arrange the hobbies in a clean, responsive grid layout.
Style the images with a border radius, shadow, or hover effects for interaction.
Ensure the page is responsive for mobile users.
Optionally, add some hover effects to images or titles to make the page more interactive.
